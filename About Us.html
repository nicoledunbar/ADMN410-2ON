<h2> About Us </h2>
	<h3> History</h3>
	<p>In 1956, Robert D. McFluffy opened Durham House of Pets.  His goal was to supply college students with friendly house animals that would bring joy to stressed out kids. McFluffy became very successful and became the best selling pet store in all of New Hampshire.  In 1998, McFluffy retired and gave his keys to George Clooney.  George Clooney acquired other celebrities to work at the pet store.
	<h3> Why Use Us </h3>
